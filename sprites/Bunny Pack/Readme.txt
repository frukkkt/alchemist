GIVTY ASSET PACK
Thanks for downloading! Hope this brings some nice vibes to your project ðŸŒ¿

ðŸ“Œ TIPS
You can use these assets in any 2D game engine â€” Godot, Unity, RPG Maker, etc.
Import the spritesheets as multiple sprites (frame-by-frame)
Aseprite files are included if you want to tweak or recolor anything

ðŸ“Œ SETUP
Most character sprites are sized for 32x32 or 48x48 canvases
Tilemaps follow a 16x16 grid â€” adjust your slice settings accordingly
If something looks off, try "pixel perfect" settings or turn off filtering

ðŸ“Œ REMEMBER
You're free to use these assets in both personal and commercial projects
Feel free to modify them! Just donâ€™t resell or redistribute the raw files
